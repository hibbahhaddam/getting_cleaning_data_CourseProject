# Getting and Cleaning Data CourseProject

Hibbah Haddam

## Goal
The purpose of this project was to prepare a clean and tidy data set, using data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

Further information on how the data was collected, or the study design can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


This particular repo contains
- README.md file with a brief overview of the project
- run_analysis.R: an R script to perform the analysis
- tidyData.txt: a file containing the tidy data set
- CodeBook.md: a code book with a description of the variables, data, and transformations to clean the data


## Summary of the Project
Derived from the course website:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
